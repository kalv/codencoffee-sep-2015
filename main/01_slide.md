## Why this talk?
- Team culture = Successful Team (Company)
- I'm still learning

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## Why **Development** team culture?
- Most of this is team culture (community)
- Developers tend to be smart people
- Habits that need to be formed are different

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## What it is Not
- Free Food / Beer
- Dashboard in the office
- Swag, t-shirts / hoodies
- Foosball table / Ping-pong

## Run Away

"We have a great team culture, everyone drops tools on a Friday to share a beer and play ping pong"

## Edgar Schein

<em>(Sloan Professor of Management Emeritus at the Sloan School of Management at the MIT)</em>

A pattern of **shared basic assumptions** learned by a group as it solved its problems of external adaptation and internal integration (â€¦) A product of joint learning.

Culture is the stuff people do without noticing it

## My take

Culture is what is implicitly created by a group of people working with shared values

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## Development Team Culture Values

- Transparency (Trust)
- Collaboration (Shared responsbility)
- Test Everything (Always be learning)

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## Transparency

- To build great Trust be open
- Knowing why will enforce what needs to be done

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## Collaboration

- Dependent on Trust (Transparency)
- No dogmatism, everyone is different (if not stamp it out quick)

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## Test Everything

- Everything is broken, always legacy code after commit
- Give permissions to change
- Small decisions

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## Do it!
(lebouf)
Work to create Habits that encourage adopting those values

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## Transparency
- Share everything, all docs
- Discuss big decisions
- Broadcast as much as you can (allow feedback)
- 1-1s

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## Collaboration
- Github Pull Requests vs direct commits
- Pair programming on areas of complexity (define well)
- Ask for input even if it looks done

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## Test Everything
- Starts with measuring, know whether something is getting better or worse
- CI / Automated Testing (prevents quality loss)
- RCov / Code Climate
- Change user story process and measure velocity change
- Hold Retrospectives, don't wait for perfect structure, learn on the go!

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## There's more!

- This is only a touch on the surface, lots of docs and better presentations
- I feel though it's important to focus on few than too many and test
