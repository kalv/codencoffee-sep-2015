## Me

- @kalv on twitter

- Worked with web since 1995 *(/cgi-bin ftw!)*
- Still writing code
- Love coffee (hence Brewhouse)

## Why this talk?
- Team culture = Successful Team (Company)
- I'm still learning

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## Why **Development** team culture?
- Most of this is team culture (community)
- Developers tend to be smart people
- Habits that need to be formed are different

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## What it is not
- Free food, beer
- Dashboard in the office
- Swag, t-shirts, hoodies
- Foosball table, ping-pong

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## Run Away

>&ldquo;We have a great team culture, everyone drops tools on a Friday to share a beer and play ping pong.&rdquo;

## Edgar Schein
### (Sloan Professor of Management Emeritus at the Sloan School of Management at the MIT)

A pattern of **shared basic assumptions** learned by a group as it solved its problems of external adaptation and internal integration (â€¦) A product of joint learning.

## Henrik Kniberg
### (Agile guru, working with Spotify / Lego)

Culture is the stuff people do without noticing it

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## My take

Culture is what is implicitly created by a group of people working with shared values

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## Development Team Culture Values

- Transparency (Trust)
- Collaboration (Shared responsbility)
- Test Everything (Always be learning)

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## Transparency

- Build good Trust within the team
- Knowing why will enforce what needs to be done

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## Collaboration

- Dependent on Trust (Transparency)
- Good Collaboration comes from when everyone understands one another
- No dogmatism, everyone is different (if not stamp it out quick)

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## Test Everything

- Everything is broken, all code is legacy after commit
- Give permission to change
- Small decisions and change often

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## Do it!

Create habits to encourage adoption of the values

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## Transparency
- Share everything, all docs
- Discuss big decisions
- Broadcast as much as you can (encourage feedback)
- 1-1s

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## Collaboration
- Github Pull Requests vs direct commits
- Pair programming on areas of complexity (define)
- Ask for input even if it looks complete
- Encourage discussion on silo'd work

<!SLIDE bullets transition=fade>
## Test Everything
- Measure everything!
- CI / Automated Testing
- Code coverage / Code Climate
- Change user story process and measure velocity change
- Do Retrospectives. Don't wait for perfect retro, learn on the go!

## Done. Kind of.

- This is only a touch on the surface, lots of better documentation
- Other values that might align with the company
- I feel it's important to focus on few than too many and test!
